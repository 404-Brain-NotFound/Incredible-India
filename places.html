               <p>Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. 
                It's known for its palm-lined beaches and backwaters, a network of canals. 
                Inland are the Western Ghats, mountains whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations as well as wildlife. 
                National parks like Eravikulam and Periyar, plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are home to elephants, langur monkeys and tigers.
                It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west.
                Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.<br>

               <p> Mizoram  is a state in northeastern India, with Aizawl as its capital city. 
                   The name is derived from "Mizo", the name of the native inhabitants, and "Ram", which means land, and thus Mizoram means "land of the Mizos".
                    Within the northeast region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur.
                 The state also shares a 722-kilometre border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.

                               <p>The Taj Mahal  is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra.
                                    It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
                                    It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan, the builder. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
                                    which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.                               </p>

                                       <p>The Harmandir Sahib, also known as Darbar Sahib (Punjabi pronunciation: [dəɾbaːɾ saːh(ɪ)b]; "Abode of God", "Exalted Holy Court"), is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[2][3] It is the preeminent pilgrimage site of Sikhism.[2][4] It is usually called the Golden Temple in English, because it is plated with gold.

                                            The Gurdwara sahib is built around a man-made pool (Sarovar) that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577.
                                             Guru Arjan, the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mian Mir – a Muslim Pir of Lahore, to lay its foundation stone in 1589.
                                              In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site Ath Sath Tirath (lit. "shrine of 68 pilgrimages").
                                               The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Muslim armies from Afghanistan and the Mughal Empire.
                                             The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it in 1757 and again in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage. </p>

                                                   The landmark has become known globally as a symbol of Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognized structures in India.
                                                    The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 400 years. 
                                                    While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for the popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. 
                                                   Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid-ul-fitr.                               </p>

                                    Hyderabadi biryani is generally believed to have originated in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, of the historic Hyderabad State, as a blend of Mughlai and Iranian cuisine. 
                                    Hyderabadi biryani is a staple of Indian cuisine.               </p>

                                       <p> Thali refers to the metal plate that a thali meal may be served on. 
                                       Thali is popular in Punjab  , Uttar Pradesh and other states in North India. 
                                       The idea behind a Thali is to offer all the 6 different flavors of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy on one single plate (technically the last two are actually forms of chemesthesis rather than true flavors).
                                        According to Indian food custom, a proper meal should be a perfect balance of all these 6 flavors. Restaurants typically offer a choice of vegetarian or meat-based thalis. Vegetarian thalis are very typical and commonplace in Tamil Nadu canteens , and are a popular lunch choice.</p>

                                                    Many Indian desserts are fried foods made with sugar, milk or condensed milk. Ingredients and preferred types of dessert vary by region.
                                                     In the eastern part of India, for example, most are based on milk products.
                                                    Many are flavoured with almonds and pistachios, spiced with cardamon, nutmeg, cloves and black pepper, and decorated with nuts, or with gold or silver leaf.                          </p>
